/**
 * Thin wrapper around `useQuery` that enforces some sensible defaults so that
 * we do not hammer the backend with fuzzy-stop requests.
 *
 * 1. Only start searching once the user has typed a minimum number of
 *    characters (`MIN_LEN`). This alone cuts the number of queries
 *    dramatically because many one-or two-letter permutations are avoided.
 * 2. Cache the results aggressively on the client so that navigating back and
 *    forth (or re-focusing the window) does not trigger another network
 *    request for an already-seen term.
